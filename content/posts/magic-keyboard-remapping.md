I recently got a new [Magic Keyboard with Touch ID](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK73LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-and-numeric-keypad-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-us-english-white-keys). It's an incredible keyboard, but Apple has moved the `fn` key to the very bottom-right. My brain is wired for the bottom-right to be the `control` key.

Apple allows you to remap basically every modifier key very easily. Open System Settings->Keyboard->Keyboard Shortcuts->Modifier Keys. They call it the "Globe Key". I've remapped mine to Control and it's perfect!
