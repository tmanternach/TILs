Courtesy of [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119987) on Hacker News, Today I learned that "Windows 7 is older today (15 years) than Windows 95 was when Windows 7 was released (14 years)."

I will always remember Windows 7 fondly. I was in college when the Beta came out. It was so clean and fast at the time.
