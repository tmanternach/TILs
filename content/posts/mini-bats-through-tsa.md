Today I Learned that you are allowed to have a small "mini-bat" in your carry-on at the Louisville Airport only. Items like this are normally considered a weapon and must be in a checked bag; but The [Lousiville Slugger Museum & Factory](https://www.sluggermuseum.com/) gives these mini-bats out for free on a tour. I imagine TSA got very tired of fighting people about this and just carved out an exemption.
